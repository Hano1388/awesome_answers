class User < ApplicationRecord
  # has_secure_password is a built-in rails method taht provides user authentication features for the model its called in
  # 1. It will automatically add a presence validator for password field
  # 2. When given a password, it will generate a salt, then it will hash the salt and password combo then store the result into the database field (uses the gem 'bcrypt')
  # 3. If you skip the 'password-confirmation' field, then it won't give you a validation error for that. If you provide password-confirmation field, it will validate password against it
  # 4. The user instance gets the method 'authenticate' which will allow us to verify if a user entered the correct password. It returns the user if correct otherwise it returns 'nil'
